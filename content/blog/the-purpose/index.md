description: Initial post for a new blog to serve as a repository of my work.

The purpose of this blog is to track what it's like for myself as someone who is switching careers from a non-traditional "information technology" background into software engineering as a profession.

My background professionally is as an educator. I was a special education teacher for over 10 years and focused on co-teaching mathematics at the secondary level. I have also taught a class of students with emotional disabilities at the Kindergarten through 8th grade level.
